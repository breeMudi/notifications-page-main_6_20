### What I learned

Through this exercise, I Learnt how to call and manipulate parentElements in the Document Object Model
The number of notification changes if a new update is viewed by the user. To implement this, a count of (unread) update is carried out anytime an unread update is clicked by the user

This project was carried out with a mobile-first approach. The picture below shows the static (image 1) and active states (i=mage 2 and 3) of the exercise.
